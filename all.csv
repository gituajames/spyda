65,1 out of 5,Poor camera,"The advertising features of the phone is exaggerated. The worst camera ever, no safaricom icon, no earphones and has very few app in. The phone is big for nothing.

66,1 out of 5,Dont Waste your money on this,"The phone is super loud and someone sited 3 meters away from you can hear all your conversation with the other party. It hangs often , overheats with 30 minutes of continuous use, it has a way of pressing random buttons when you are talking , it will shows WIFI to be ON but in truth the Wifi is off and you can only confirm the true status of WIFI from the settings menu, when you close applications there must be one application that is left running and you have no way of closing it.

The features stated on the phone specification are fantastic but the user experience is very poor.Look somewhere else , this is not worth your 15K",22-05-2023,22-05-2023by JOHN

75,5 out of 5,I like it,"I took my time to use this product M5 and it is really amazing...it has exited my expectations.
1.The RAM 8GB is real-100%

3.50MP rear cam i doubt-90%
4.18MW Faster charge is amazing

82,4 out of 5,50/50,"The hardware is good but the software not so much. I am hoping an upgrade will make it better.Examples are like you switch off wifi but the wifi icon in the notification bar is still on but wifi is off, brightness is a bit too low, hardware can support 50mp but the quality is at best 13mp. There are very few customization choices unless you download your own launcher. You can either have 2 sim cards or one sim card and a memory card. Other promises like fast charging hold true, also does not come with much bloatware (custom apps) so the storage is truly large.",04-04-2023,04-04-2023by Buyer
